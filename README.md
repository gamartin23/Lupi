# Lupi
Lupi is a RCA assisting tool that allows for synchronised log and video data to be analysed at once. Exporting and importing .lupi files allows for sharing analysis easily. Lupi is compatible with any kind of timestamped UTC logs plus standard video formats. Lupi was designed around UE5's logging files, yet other logging files can be used.
Lupi will attempt to synchronise logs and video around UTC timestamps, so please ensure logging is UTC timestamped.
Lupi is named after one of my beloved cat's nickname, her name is Luonnotar.
